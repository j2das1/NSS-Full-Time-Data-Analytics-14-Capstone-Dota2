# NSS DDA-14 Capstone Project

# Motivation

This project is near and dear to my heart.  I have been a fan of Dota since I firsted played in 2005.  
I wanted to delve deeper into the main attraction for dota players which is The International and why it was so successful.
The motivation was to dive into the data surrounding The International and to uncover
insights that was unobtainable to me initally. Motivation
Here you will go into more detail about why you have chosen this project.
I have been watching and playing Dota 2 since it was Dota 1(Dota Allstars) on Warcraft 3: Reign of Chaos custom maps.
I love the game and think there would be enough data to find and clean in order to make a presentation.
I have watched every International and have attended 2 of them in person.
