# NSS-Full-Time-Data-Analytics-14-Capstone-Dota2
NSS DDA-14 Capstone Project

Motivation
This project is near and dear to my heart.  I have been a fan of Dota since I firsted played in 2005.  
I wanted to delve deeper into the main attraction for dota players which is The International and why it was so successful.
The motivation was to dive into the data surrounding The International and to uncover
insights that was unobtainable to me initally.

Data questions
1. The true history behind the creation of DotA(how and why it began) *
2. How much money was made by players and teams throughout the years *
3. As a worldwide esports game, which players participated from each country *
4. Attendance and viewing numbers for The International
5. How much money was made by the parent company Valve *
6. Why was there such a decline in The International prize pool *
7. Esports Stars

The Process
Acquring the data
I scraped the total players from each country from liquipedia.com and scraped the prize pool amounts
from wikipedia.com using Python requests and pandas.  Data was also aquired through listed websites in the data source section.

Cleaning Data
Data was cleaned using excel and python

Insights Gained
*work in progress*

Executive Summary
This section provides an overview of the project. It should briefly touch on the motivation, data question, data to be used, along with any known assumptions and challenges.

Motivation
Here you will go into more detail about why you have chosen this project.
I have been watching and playing Dota 2 since it was Dota 1(Dota Allstars) on Warcraft 3: Reign of Chaos custom maps.  I love the game and think there would be enough data to find and clean in order to make a presentation.  I have watched every International and have attended 2 of them in person.  

Data Question
Present your question. Feel free to include any research/articles that are relevant or show where others have attempted to answer this question.

I want to show the overall growth and decline of The International (dota 2 tournament)
-When and where it began
- Countries that participated
- Financial and Attendance Statistics(virtually)
- Winners and Losers of the tournament
- How much the community crowd funded each international beginning in 2013
-Historical impact on the gaming community











Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The intended target will be fans of gaming specifically MOBA genre

This presentation will be a 10 to 14 minute presentation via canva.
