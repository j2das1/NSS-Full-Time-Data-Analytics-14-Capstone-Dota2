# NSS-Full-Time-Data-Analytics-14-Capstone-Dota2
NSS DDA-14 Capstone Project

Motivation
This project is near and dear to my heart.  I have been a fan of Dota since I firsted played in 2005.  
I wanted to delve deeper into the main attraction for dota players which is The International and why it was so successful.
The motivation was to dive into the data surrounding The International and to uncover
insights that was unobtainable to me initally.

Data questions
1. The true history behind the creation of DotA(how and why it began) *
2. How much money was made by players and teams throughout the years *
3. As a worldwide esports game, which players participated from each country *
4. Attendance and viewing numbers for The International
5. How much money was made by the parent company Valve *
6. Why was there such a decline in The International prize pool *
7. Esports Stars
